## Section 1 1. What is Node and why would we use it? A runtime environment for running JS. 2. How do we initialize a folder for use with node? In terminal, type: NPM init. 3. What does `npm init` do? Makes sure all packets are installed & available. 4. What is a module and how does it relate to Node? A container(file) of related code allowing that code to be imported & exported into other files. 5. I need to install a node module before I can use it. How can I install a node module so that it is accessable in javascript? In terminal: "npm install --save nameOfFile.js" 6. How would I import a module into node? - Use the keyword "require"... var require = function(path) { ... return module.exports; } - Then in your main.js "require"... // main.js var greetings = require("./greetings.js") - Use the methods of greetings.js as a property of the greetings variable in main.js... var greetings - require("./greetings.js"); greetings.sayHelloInEnglish(); greetings.sayHelloInSpanish(); 7. When using require(), where is the module being pulled in from? module.export. ??? 8. List some common modules we have used in node. There are at least two. require, req, res ## Section 2 #### Express Setup 1. What is Express and why would we want to use it? A web app server framework. 2. How do we import express into our node application? 3. After Express is imported, we need to initialize it. We can save this to a variable so that we can reuse it later. What would this line of code look like? 4. What is app.use()? What does it do? 5. What are static files? Why would we want a static file? 6. In contrast, what is the opposite of a static file? Why would we want a dynamic file being served? 7. What would we pass into app.use() to serve up static files? *Hint: This one-liner doesn't really change.* 8. What does the module body-parser do? 9. We need to tell express that we want to use body parser. Simplying requiring it isn't enough to activate it. How do we tell express we want to use body-parser? 10. If we use body-parser, we can retreive data from a POST (RESTful routing). How would we access this data from the 'req' object? `app.get('/', function(req, res) {})` #### EJS & Setup 1. What is an EJS file? 2. Is a EJS a static or a dynamic file? 3. Why would we want to use an EJS? 4. Is EJS used by a templating engine? 5. If so, how do we tell express to use the ejs templating engine? *hint: app.use()* 6. Write out the syntax tags for using javascript in EJS. If it helps, add 2+2 in this div tag: `
<div></div>` 7. We render ejs only when we are ready to send the page to the user. How do we render EJS for the browser? What is the function? *hint: this would be within the route (app.get(); )* 8. Following up on the last question, how do we pass data into EJS template? *hint: you will modify the previous answer* ## Section 3 #### Routes 1. req params vs req query 2. Write a route that utilizes req.params 3. Adding onto the previous question: Inside the callback of the route, how can I access those parameters? *hint: thing back to /add/:x/:y/* 4. Identify the parts of this url: `localhost:3000/results?search=star+wars` 5. What part of the url above matches the express route? 6. What is the difference between using req.params and req.query 7. How can I access the query key/value pairs inside the route callback? ## Section 4 1. What is RESTful Routing? 2. What is CRUD? 3. How to set your node/express app to stay open on a certain port? #### Breakdowns Identify the following parts: `var express = require('express');` `app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'static')));` `app.get('/', function(req, res){});` `app.set('view engine', 'ejs');` `app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));`
